Computer Vision and Deep learning 

Project1 - Facial keypoint detection
Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial
keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.
image processing and feature extraction techniques are used to programmatically represent different facial features. Use knowledge of deep learning techniques to program a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints. Facial keypoints include
points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial
tracking to emotion recognition.

Project2 - Automatic image captioning
Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an input
image.
Image captioning requires that creating a complex deep learning model with two components: a CNN that
transforms an input image into a set of features, and an RNN that turns those features into rich, descriptive
language.

Project3 - Landmark detection and tracking 
Use feature detection and keypoint descriptors to build a map of the environment with SLAM (simultaneous
localization and mapping).
Implement a robust method for tracking an object over time, using elements of probability, motion models,
and linear algebra. Localization techniques are widely used in
autonomous vehicle navigation.
